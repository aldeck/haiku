	\brief Abstract class representing things that are positionable and
		resizable by objects of the BLayout class.

	The BLayoutItem class provides an interface that is meant to be used almost
	exclusively by objects of the BLayout class. Despite this, there are some
	methods that are provided for other users of the class.

	\warning This class is not yet finalized, if you use it in your software
	assume that it will break some time in the future.

	\brief Returns the requested alignment for this item.

	The value returned from this method is used in BLayoutItem::AlignInFrame(),
	which BLayouts use to position and resize items. In a vertical BGroupLayout,
	for example, although each item recieves the same horizontal area, each item
	can use that area differently, aligning to the left, right or center for
	example.

	If a BLayoutItem does not have height for width constraints
	(HasHeightForWidth() returns \c false) it does not need to implement this
	method.

	dereferencing them.

/*!
	\name Overriding size constraints and alignment.

	Although the explicit constraints placed on an item are not enforced by the
	BLayoutItem class, all Haiku BLayoutItem subclasses will use the
	BLayoutUtils::ComposeSize() or BLayoutUtils::ComposeAlignment() functions
	in when reporting these constraints. It is recommended that all subclasses
	do this as well, the BAbstractLayoutItem class provides any easy way to
	include this behaviour in your class.
